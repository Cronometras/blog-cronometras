## Importance of Takt Time

At the heart of industrial production lies an essential metric, a compass that marks the rhythm and cadence of processes: takt time. This concept, of German origin, is the beacon that guides companies in their pursuit of efficiency, quality, and customer adaptation. In this article, we will unravel the mysteries of takt time, its calculation, application, and benefits, illustrating it with examples and practical cases.

## What is Takt Time

Takt time is the average time needed to produce a product, adjusting to customer demand. It is the pulse that beats at the heart of production, marking the interval between the start of manufacturing one product and the next. This time is not imposed by the company, but dictated by the customer, which makes it a crucial element in a lean environment, where waste elimination and adaptation to the consumption rhythm are fundamental.

## How to Calculate Takt Time

To calculate takt time, divide the net working time of a typical workday by the number of products that the customer requires in a day. For example, if a company works 8 hours daily, with a 25-minute break, and its customer demands 546 units per day, the takt time will be 52 seconds.

- 8*60 = 480 minutes of presence at work per day

- 480-25 = 455 minutes of effective work per day

- 480/546 = 0.879 minutes per piece required by the customer

- 0.879*60 = 52.747 seconds per piece required by the customer per day

This calculation, seemingly simple, is the key that opens the doors to efficient production adapted to the customer.

## How to Apply Takt Time to Adjust Production

Applying takt time in a production line involves precise synchronization of all parts involved. Each task, each element, must adjust to this rhythm to achieve a continuous flow and avoid bottlenecks or waiting times. This line balancing is an industrial engineering technique that seeks to distribute work evenly among production stations, thus optimizing performance, quality, and costs.

To apply takt time to a production line, the following steps should be followed:

- Identify the tasks and elements that make up the production process, as well as the precedence and sequence constraints that exist between them.

- Determine the times of each task and element, using measurement methods such as time study, work sampling, or predetermined standards.

- Calculate the target cycle time and takt time, according to demand and available time to produce.

- Assign tasks and elements to workstations, using a balancing method such as Kilbridge and Wester or Rank Positional Weight.

- Evaluate the efficiency and degree of balance of the production line, comparing station times and actual cycle time with takt time and target cycle time.

- Implement the balancing and verify its operation, making adjustments if necessary.

- Control and improve balancing periodically, adapting it to changing conditions of demand, capacity, quality, and resources.

## Benefits of Takt Time for Productive Capacity

The benefits of takt time for productive capacity are numerous. First, it reduces inventories, as only what is needed is produced, thus avoiding accumulating finished or in-process products that occupy space and generate costs. Additionally, it reduces waiting and idle times, synchronizing the work rhythm with the consumption rhythm. This translates into cost reduction, as waste and unproductive times are eliminated.

On the other hand, takt time improves the quality of processes, reducing the probability of errors, failures, or rejections. This translates into greater customer satisfaction and less need for inspection and repair. Furthermore, by focusing on customer value, product quality is improved, increasing loyalty and recommendation.

Finally, takt time increases productivity, optimizing process performance and allowing more to be produced in the same time. This translates into greater competitiveness and market share.

## Examples and Practical Cases of Takt Time

### Example 1:

In a furniture factory, there is a work shift of 7 hours daily during all 7 days of the week. From this time, 15 minutes of rest and 5 minutes of preventive maintenance are subtracted. Thus, the available production time is:

- Total time = 7hrs * 60 = 420min

- Production time = 420min - 15min - 5min

- Production time = 400min * 60sec = 24,000sec

- The customer's weekly demand is 350 pieces of furniture, which is equivalent to:

- Daily demand = 350 furniture/7 days = 50 furniture/day

Therefore, the Takt Time is calculated:

- Takt Time = 24,000sec / 50 furniture

- Takt Time = 480sec/furniture

This means that the customer is buying one piece of furniture every 480 seconds, which determines the production rhythm for this product and its components.

### Example 2:

A juice packaging company has a workday of 9 hours. From this time, 30 minutes of rest and 10 minutes of cleaning and machine maintenance are deducted. Thus, the available production time is:

- Total time = 9hrs * 60 = 540min

- Production time = 540min - 30min - 10min

- Production time = 500min * 60sec = 30,000sec

The customer's daily demand is 600 bottles of juice, so the Takt Time is calculated:

- Takt Time = 30,000sec / 600 bottles

- Takt Time = 50sec/bottle

This indicates that the customer is buying one bottle of juice every 50 seconds, which establishes the production rhythm for this product and its components.

## Differences Between Takt Time, Cycle Time, and Lead Time

These three concepts mark the rhythm and destiny of processes, each has its own melody, its own meaning, and its own function in the symphony of efficiency and quality.

### Cycle Time

Cycle Time, on the other hand, is the time it takes for a process to complete, from start to finish. It is the rhythm of the dance of workers and machines, moving in unison to create a product. This time includes both effective work time and waiting and transfer times, and is a key indicator of efficiency and production capacity.

### Lead Time

Lead Time, finally, is the time that elapses from when the customer places an order until they receive the finished product. It is the time of waiting, the time that the customer must wait to see their demand satisfied. This time includes not only the Cycle Time, but also other processes such as order taking, raw material preparation, transportation, and delivery.

In summary, Takt Time is the rhythm at which production must occur to satisfy customer demand, Cycle Time is the rhythm at which production actually occurs, and Lead Time is the time the customer must wait to receive their order. Three concepts, three different melodies that intertwine in the symphony of industrial production.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, takt time is the compass that marks the rhythm of industrial production, adapting to customer demand and seeking efficiency and quality. Its calculation and application are essential for any company that wants to optimize its processes and satisfy its customers. Like an orchestra conductor, takt time coordinates all elements of production, creating a symphony of efficiency and quality.
