Time and Motion Study (MTM) is an ergonomics discipline focused on analyzing, designing, and improving work systems. This technique is used to optimize the use of time and movements in a job, that is, to improve efficiency and productivity while minimizing costs.

## Process Optimization

Time and motion study focuses on optimizing how a worker performs a task, from start to finish. This discipline concentrates on reducing work times, minimizing movements, eliminating redundant steps, increasing productivity, and designing better work systems. This is achieved through the application of various techniques, tools, instruments, and procedures.

The application of time and motion study begins with collecting information about the current task. This includes the time it takes to perform the task, the number of movements, and the amount of energy needed to complete it. This information is analyzed to identify weaknesses in the work system.

## Work Method Improvement

Once problems are identified, the goal is to design better work systems that are more efficient and productive. This can be achieved by modifying procedures, using better tools, or installing improved equipment.

Time and motion study has become an indispensable tool for improving productivity and efficiency across a wide range of industries, from manufacturing to agriculture. This discipline helps ensure that workers are working safely, efficiently, and effectively to maximize company benefits.

## Comparison Between Different MTM Systems

There are various types of predetermined time standards such as MTM-1, MTM-2, MTM-3, and MTM-UAS, each designed to meet the specific needs of an industry or type of work. These standards allow employees and managers to evaluate and improve the efficiency and productivity of work processes.

| System | Basic Movements | Precision | Ease of Use |

## MOST

Is a predetermined time system that allows for analyzing any manual operation and some equipment operations. It is based on the concept of fundamental activities, which are the combinations of movements performed to manipulate objects. The basic forms of movements are described by sequences, which are the units of analysis of the system.

The name MOST is derived from the acronym for Maynard Operation Sequence Technique, in honor of Harold B. Maynard, one of the pioneers of time and motion study.

The MOST technique is used to determine standard time, labor cost, production schedule, efficiency, and expenses of a production process. It is also used to improve work methods, reduce waste, optimize workplace design, and increase worker satisfaction.

There are several variants of the MOST technique, depending on the level of detail and precision required. The most common are:

- Basic-MOST: Is the most universal variant and applies to operations that last from less than a minute to about ten minutes. It has three types of sequences: general movement, controlled movement, and tool use.

- Mini-MOST: Is the simplest variant and applies to repetitive and short operations, of less than a minute. It has two types of sequences: general movement and controlled movement.

- Maxi-MOST: Is the most complex variant and applies to non-repetitive and long operations, of more than a few minutes. It has four types of sequences: general movement, controlled movement, tool use, and equipment use.

- Admin-MOST: Is the variant that applies to office work operations, such as filing, data entry, and typing. It has four types of sequences: general movement, controlled movement, tool use, and computer equipment use.
