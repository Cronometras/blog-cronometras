When opening the application, you will see a login screen

Login in industrial time study app CronometrasApp

Enter the access data to the application that was communicated to you by email.

Once you have accessed for the first time, on subsequent occasions when you open your app, your user email will be auto-filled and you can access using your fingerprint.

Remember that you should only install the app on the device where you are going to use it, as each license is valid for 1 device, so if you try to login on 2 different devices, a license error will appear.
