When accessing the home screen for the first time, we will see a blank screen. This is because we have not yet generated any work study.

To create our first study, we will click on the circular button at the bottom right of our home screen, thus accessing the Study information screen.

Once inside the information or identification screen of the study, we will record all the necessary information to be able to identify our work study in the future.

We will see that there are different fields; the fields that have a white background are optional fields, and the 3 fields that have a green background are mandatory fields.

We fill in at least the 3 mandatory fields and click on the submit study data button located at the end of this screen.

With this, we will have created our first work study.

## Practical Application

This knowledge is fundamental for industrial engineering professionals and production managers who seek to optimize processes and increase productivity. The systematic application of these techniques allows companies to remain competitive in an increasingly demanding global market.

## Additional Resources

To delve deeper into this topic, we recommend using our CronometrasApp application, specifically designed to facilitate the implementation of time studies in industrial environments. This tool allows for precise measurements and generates detailed reports that facilitate decision-making.

## Conclusion

Mastering industrial time study techniques is essential for any professional seeking to optimize production processes. The systematic application of these methods not only improves operational efficiency but also significantly contributes to cost reduction and increased business competitiveness. Remember that precision in measurement and rigorous data analysis are the basis for establishing reliable time standards that drive continuous improvement in your organization.
