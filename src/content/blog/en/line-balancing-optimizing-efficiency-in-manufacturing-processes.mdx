Line balancing is a fundamental technique in industrial engineering that allows for efficient distribution of work among stations in manufacturing processes. Its objective is to assign tasks in a balanced way to maximize productivity, leverage resources, and meet the required demand.

In this article, we will explain in detail the concept of line balancing, its importance, the main elements, and steps to follow to successfully implement it in practice.

## **What is Line Balancing?**

Line balancing consists of organizing the manual or automated operations necessary to produce a product, distributing them appropriately among workstations arranged along a production line.

Balancing seeks to equalize work times at each station to avoid bottlenecks, minimize waiting and idle times, and achieve a continuous flow in the production process. A balanced production line allows for increased productivity, reduced costs and inventories, and improved quality and customer satisfaction.

## **Basic concepts of line balancing**

Line balancing is based on some basic concepts that are important to understand:

- **Product:** good to be manufactured. It can comprise a single item or a family.

- **Production line:** arrangement of workstations where successive and coordinated operations are performed to manufacture a product.

- **Workstation:** point on the line where a specific operation or activity is executed. It can be a machine, an operator, or a group of them.

- **Tasks**: steps required to transform raw materials into finished products. Tasks are divided into elements.

- **Element:** indivisible operation that must be executed at a workstation.

- **Cycle time**: total time to manufacture one unit of the product.

- **Takt time:** rhythm at which products must be manufactured to satisfy customer demand.

- **Precedence:** mandatory sequence in which certain tasks must be performed.

- **Work content**: Contains the time needed to complete all tasks on a unit.

## **Objectives of line balancing**

The main objectives pursued with line balancing are:

- Equalize work times at each station.

- Avoid idleness and waiting times.

- Achieve a continuous flow.

- Reduce costs and inventories.

- Increase productivity.

- Improve quality and customer satisfaction.

## **Types of lines susceptible to balancing**

There are mainly two types of lines that can be balanced:

**Manufacturing lines:** used to produce components and parts. The rhythm is usually determined by the machines.

**Assembly lines:** used to assemble components into final products. The rhythm usually depends on the operators.

Both types of lines can be balanced to improve their efficiency and productivity. Any line with bottlenecks is susceptible to applying balancing.

## **Preconditions for balancing**

To be able to balance a line, certain conditions must be met:

- **Production volume:** must justify the balancing effort.

- **Continuity:** continuous supply of materials and prevention of failures.

- **Stability:** the process should not change constantly.

- **Standardization:** standardized times must exist; for this, time studies of each task must be previously conducted and a standard time assigned. This is the most costly part of the process; to accelerate it, [cronometrasApp](https://cronometras.com/) can be used, an app for conducting work time studies.

- **Flexibility:** operators must be able to rotate between positions.

## **Line balancing methods**

There are various methods for performing balancing, among them we find:

- **Trial and error method**: Randomly assigns tasks to stations by trial and error. Simple but not optimized.

- **Graphical distribution method**: Represents tasks in a graph to visually identify overloads.

- **Positional weights method**: Assigns tasks according to a combination of time and position in the process.

- **Kilbridge and Wester method**: Prioritizes tasks of longer duration respecting precedence constraints.

- **Fixed cycle time method**: Assigns tasks until matching the takt time and then moves to the next station.

- **Mathematical and heuristic algorithms**: Make use of mathematical and computational models to optimize balancing.

## **Steps to perform balancing**

The typical steps to balance a line are:

- **Define the process:** identify all tasks and elements.

- **Determine times:** through time study or historical data.

- **Calculate the takt time:** based on customer demand.

- **Develop precedence diagrams.**

- **Calculate theoretical number of stations.**

- **Assign tasks to stations:** using priority rules.

- **Verify efficiency:** through mathematical calculations.

- **Implement and evaluate:** adjust based on results.

## **Let's analyze each step in greater depth:**

- Define the production process

An exhaustive analysis of each stage of the process must be carried out through operation diagrams, plant tours, operator interviews, etc. to identify each activity, no matter how minimal. It includes times for raw material preparation, machine setup, processing, inspection, cleaning, maintenance, operator movements, etc. The level of detail must be sufficient to be able to balance adequately.

- Determine the times

Through the time study technique, standard times for each operation are calculated considering allowances for fatigue, contingencies, etc. Another option is to use average historical times. The aim is to have times that are as accurate and up-to-date as possible to represent reality.

- Calculate the takt time

The required production rhythm is determined by dividing the available productive time (shifts worked x hours per shift) by customer demand (units required in that time). This target cycle time will set the pace of the line. It should incorporate safety margins.

```
Takt Time = Available time / Demand
```

This parameter acts as a constraint for designing the balance, as no station can exceed it. It represents how much time there is, at most, to complete a unit.

- Develop precedence diagrams

Through graphics, the mandatory sequence in which certain tasks must be performed is established, as well as the interrelationships between operations. This will define constraints in the subsequent assignment of tasks to stations.

- Calculate theoretical stations

By summing all task times and dividing them by the takt time, an initial estimate of the minimum possible number of stations to achieve the required rhythm is obtained. It serves as a starting point for balancing.

```
Stations = Work Content / Takt Time
```

- Assign tasks to stations

Tasks are meticulously distributed among stations seeking feasible combinations according to constraints and applying rules such as the largest time element, minimum number of elements, maximum efficiency, avoiding leaving large gaps between stations, etc.

- Verify efficiency

Compares the total task time vs. the actual cycle time (number of stations x takt time) to determine how balanced the line has become. Less difference means greater efficiency.

- Implement and evaluate

The new balanced line is put into operation and real-time data is collected to evaluate its functioning and identify deviations.

- Make adjustments

Based on the results, experimental adjustments are made in the assignment of tasks seeking to increase efficiency.

- Continuous improvement

Once implemented, the performance of the line is constantly monitored to detect opportunities for improvement and optimize the balance over time.

Then, it is periodically audited and controlled to ensure that what was established in the balancing is being followed, applying corrective actions for deviations.

If conditions change, re-balancing is performed.

## **Keys to Effective Line Balancing**

Some tips to ensure a successful process and result in line balancing include:

- Involve key operational staff and their supervisors from the beginning. Their experience and commitment are fundamental.

- Rigorously validate the information collected about the current process before balancing (diagrams, times, etc.)

- Previously train operators in the concepts and methodology of balancing to be applied.

- Clearly communicate the objectives and expected benefits of balancing to all participants.

- Use graphical and visual representations, in addition to numerical data, to facilitate analysis.

- Evaluate several possible balancing scenarios before defining the optimal one. Don't just stick with the first one.

- Control that the new standards are met after implementing the balancing and take actions against deviations.

- Perform periodic balancing to incorporate improvements and adapt to changing conditions.

## **Other Relevant Aspects**

Finally, it's worth mentioning other important considerations regarding balancing:

- It should be integrated with the previous elimination of waste through lean manufacturing.

- It is more efficient in highly standardized and specialized production lines.

- The physical plant layout must be consistent with the balancing performed.

- Balancing must be coordinated with production scheduling in volume and variety.

- It applies to both manual and automated processes.

- The Kanban system facilitates effective balancing of assembly lines.

- It is not a unique tool. It should be combined with continuous improvement and process redesign.

## **Example of line balancing**

Below is an example of line balancing using the **Kilbridge and Wester method**:

- **Process tasks**

| **Task** | **Time (s)** | **Precedences** |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| A         | 15             | -                |
| B         | 5              | A                |
| C         | 10             | A                |
| D         | 8              | B                |
| E         | 6              | C                |
| F         | 12             | D, E             |

**Calculate takt time:**

- Desired production: 1000 units/day
- Available time: 480 minutes/day
- Takt time = 480 min/1000 units = 0.48 min/unit = 29 s/unit

**Calculate theoretical stations:**

- Total task time = 15 + 5 + 10 + 8 + 6 + 12 = 56 s
- Theoretical stations = 56 s / 29 s/unit = 1.93 = 2 stations

**Assign tasks to stations:**

| **Station** | **Task** | **Time** |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| 1             | A         | 15         |
| 1             | C         | 10         |
| 2             | B         | 5          |
| 2             | D         | 8          |
| 2             | E         | 6          |
| 2             | F         | 12         |

**Verify efficiency:**

- Actual cycle time = 2 stations * 29 s/station = 58 s
- Efficiency = (Task times / Actual cycle time) x 100 = (56 s / 58 s) x 100 = 96.6%
