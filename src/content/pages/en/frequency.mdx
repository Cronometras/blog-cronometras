    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 space-y-2">
      <li>Accurately record random or irregular activities</li>
      <li>Visualize all frequency elements in a single organized view</li>
      <li>Edit and adjust parameters to refine your studies</li>
      <li>Establish realistic standards based on real data</li>
      <li>Improve resource allocation and planning</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
      According to recent studies on industrial productivity, companies that implement advanced time measurement systems like CRONOMETRAS achieve <strong>productivity increases of up to 15-20%</strong> in their operations.
