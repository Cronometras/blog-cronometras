* **Machine Stopped (machine-stopped):** Operations performed with the machine completely stopped, where the operator has total control over execution time.
* **Machine Running (machine-running):** Manual activities performed while the machine operates automatically, optimizing productivity through simultaneous tasks.
* **Machine Time (machine-time):** Periods where the machine works autonomously, crucial for calculating productive capacities and cycle times.

* **Repetitive Elements:** Operations that occur in every work cycle consistently, forming the basis of the regular cycle time. Fundamental for establishing the base production pace.
* **Frequent Elements:** Activities that appear with a specific frequency (every N cycles), such as adjustments, verifications, or replenishments. Their correct assignment is crucial for an <a href="/en/blog/importance-of-standard-time-calculation-for-productivity-and-profitability" class="text-accent hover:underline">accurate standard time calculation</a>.

* **Detailed Description:** Field to accurately document the operation, facilitating its identification during time study and subsequent analysis.
* **Complete Classification:**
  * Type by man-machine relationship (stopped, running, machine time)
  * Repetition pattern (repetitive or frequent)
* **Frequency Configuration:** For frequent elements, define exactly:
  * Number of repetitions per cycle
  * Number of cycles between occurrences
* **Automatic Validations:** The system automatically adjusts the repetition type to 'machine-type' when 'machine-time' is selected, preventing data inconsistencies.

  }}
/>

* **Hands-Free Dictation:** Ideal for industrial environments where mobility and speed are essential.
* **Multilingual:** Works perfectly in Spanish and English, adapting to international teams.
* **Smart Detection:** Automatically finishes after 2 seconds of silence, optimizing the workflow.
* **Clear Feedback:** Specific messages for each possible problem (microphone not detected, permissions denied, etc.).

  }}
/>

* **Element Reuse:** Import predefined elements with all their attributes, ensuring consistency across different studies and analysts.
* **Smart Averaging:** Select multiple similar elements to create a new element with averaged times and allowances, ideal for establishing standards based on historical data.
* **Data Preservation:** When importing elements, time records and allowances remain intact, preserving accumulated knowledge.
* **Advanced Search:** Quickly locate specific elements using filters by name, description, or type.

* **Intuitive Reordering:** Move elements up or down in the sequence with simple clicks, adapting the method to the actual sequence of operations.
* **Contextual Editing:** Directly access the editing of any element from the main list.
* **Secure Deletion:** Delete elements with prior confirmation, including automatic cleanup of associated time records and allowances.
* **Complete View:** See all elements at a glance with their key information: sequential number, description, type, and frequency.
