*   **Complete Visualization:** Presentation of all study elements with their characteristics and times in a clear and structured format.
*   **Detailed Information:** Each element displays its description, type, frequency, observed time, activity, allowances, and calculated final time.
*   **Visual Identification:** Concurrent machine elements are highlighted with a special format (red background) for easy identification.
*   **Automatic Exclusion:** Concurrent machine elements are shown in the table but automatically excluded from total calculations to avoid duplications.

*   **Work Cycles:** Precise calculation of normal and optimal cycle from measured elements, adjusted by frequency, activity, and allowances.
*   **Contingency Times:** Automatic calculation of additional time based on the configured contingency percentage.
*   **Estimated Production:** Projection of production per shift and per hour, both under normal and optimal conditions.
*   **Saturation:** Percentage indicator of operator saturation working at normal and optimal pace, fundamental for line balancing.
*   **Maximum Activity:** Relationship between normal and optimal cycle to calculate the maximum performance achievable by the worker.
*   **Reference Values:** Data per hour, minute, and point to facilitate subsequent calculations and comparisons between studies.
