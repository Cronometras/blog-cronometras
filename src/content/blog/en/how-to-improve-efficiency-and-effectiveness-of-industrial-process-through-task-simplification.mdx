Task simplification is important in an industrial process as it can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the process. By simplifying tasks, the time and effort required to perform them are reduced, which can increase productivity and reduce the cost of the process.

In addition, task simplification can also help improve the quality of products or services produced in the industrial process. By simplifying tasks, the probability of errors is reduced and their execution is facilitated, which can increase the precision and quality of the products or services that are produced.

Finally, task simplification can also improve workplace safety. By simplifying tasks, potential sources of risk in the industrial process can be eliminated or minimized, which can help reduce the number of accidents and improve the health and well-being of workers.

## Steps to Simplify a Task

To simplify a task, it is necessary to follow a series of steps:

- Identify the task to be simplified and determine the time it takes to perform it.

- Analyze the task in detail to identify the sub-tasks that compose it and the time it takes to perform them.

- Identify possible ways to simplify the task, such as eliminating unnecessary sub-tasks, grouping similar sub-tasks, or using technology to automate tasks.

- Conduct tests to evaluate the different forms of simplification and determine which is the most effective. For this, it will be necessary to measure times in both processes, the old and the new one. You can use the industrial time study application [CronometrasApp](/) for this purpose.

- Implement the selected simplification method and track the time it takes to perform the simplified task to ensure that the desired result is being achieved.

- Make adjustments to the simplified task if necessary to further improve its efficiency and effectiveness.

## Who Should Carry Out the Simplification Process

The simplification process can be carried out by different people or groups of people in an industrial company, depending on the size and structure of the organization.

- In some cases, the simplification process can be carried out by a group of workers who perform the task in question, as they have detailed knowledge of it and can identify possible ways to simplify it.

- In other cases, the simplification process can be carried out by a team of engineers or specialists in production organization who have experience in identifying and eliminating unnecessary tasks and simplifying processes. These professionals can analyze the task in detail and propose simplification methods that can be implemented by the workers who carry out the task.

In general, the task simplification process in industry should be carried out by a group of people with specialized knowledge and skills in the subject, whether they are workers or professionals in production organization. This ensures that the simplification process is effective and that the desired results are achieved in terms of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the industrial process.

## Documentation of the Improvement Process

Once the task has been simplified, it is important to document the simplification process to ensure that it can be replicated in the future and to facilitate its monitoring and evaluation. Documentation of the simplification process may include different elements, such as:

- Detailed description of the original task, what was its execution time, and how it was simplified

- Sub-tasks eliminated or grouped in the simplification of the task

- Tools or technology used in the simplification of the task

- Results of the simplification process, including the time it takes to perform the simplified task and any improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of the process

- Adjustments made to the simplified task after its implementation

Documentation of the simplification process can be done in different formats, such as written reports, slide presentations, or digital documents. The important thing is that the documentation is clear and detailed and that it is available to all those interested in the simplification process.

Task simplification is important in an industrial process as it can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the process, increase the quality of products or services produced, and improve workplace safety.
