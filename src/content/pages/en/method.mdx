*   **Machine Stopped (machine-stopped):** Operations performed with the machine completely stopped, where the operator has full control over the execution time.
*   **Machine Running (machine-running):** Manual activities performed while the machine operates automatically, optimizing productivity through task simultaneity.
*   **Machine Time (machine-time):** Periods where the machine works autonomously, crucial for calculating production capacities and cycle times.

    alt: "Element classification based on frequency of occurrence in the work cycle"
  }}
/>

*   **Repetitive Elements:** Operations that occur in each work cycle consistently, forming the basis of the regular cycle time. Fundamental for establishing the base production rhythm.
*   **Frequency Elements:** Activities that appear with a specific frequency (every N cycles), such as adjustments, verifications, or replenishments. Their correct assignment is crucial for <a href="/en/blog/standard-time-calculation" class="text-accent hover:underline">accurate standard time calculation</a>.

*   **Detailed Description:** Field to document the operation precisely, facilitating its identification during timing and subsequent analysis.
*   **Complete Classification:**
    *   Type according to man-machine relationship (stopped, running, machine time)
    *   Repetition pattern (repetitive or frequency)
*   **Frequency Configuration:** For frequency elements, define exactly:
    *   Number of repetitions per cycle
    *   Number of cycles between occurrences
*   **Automatic Validations:** The system automatically adjusts the repetition type to 'machine-type' when 'machine-time' is selected, avoiding data inconsistencies.

  }}
/>

*   **Hands-Free Dictation:** Ideal for industrial environments where mobility and speed are essential.
*   **Multilingual:** Works perfectly in Spanish and English, adapting to international teams.
*   **Intelligent Detection:** Automatically ends after 2 seconds of silence, optimizing workflow.
*   **Clear Feedback:** Specific messages for each possible issue (microphone not detected, permissions denied, etc.).

  }}
/>

*   **Element Reuse:** Import predefined elements with all their attributes, ensuring consistency between different studies and analysts.
*   **Intelligent Averaging:** Select multiple similar elements to create a new element with averaged times and allowances, ideal for establishing standards based on historical data.
*   **Data Preservation:** When importing elements, time records and allowances remain intact, preserving accumulated knowledge.
*   **Advanced Search:** Quickly locate specific elements using filters by name, description, or type.

*   **Intuitive Reordering:** Move elements up or down in the sequence with simple clicks, adapting the method to the actual sequence of operations.
*   **Contextual Editing:** Access element editing directly from the main list.
*   **Safe Deletion:** Delete elements with prior confirmation, including automatic cleanup of associated time records and allowances.
*   **Complete Visualization:** See at a glance all elements with their key information: sequential number, description, type, and frequency.
