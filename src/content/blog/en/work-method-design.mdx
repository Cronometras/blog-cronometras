To perform correct time study, the first thing to define is the work method to be followed. This method must be standardized so that all workers perform the task in the same way.

The design of the standardized work method consists of developing a set of procedures and techniques that will be used consistently and repeatedly to carry out a task or activity. The design of the standardized work method is based on the idea that there are better ways to perform certain tasks or activities, and that these ways should be identified and standardized to obtain greater effectiveness and efficiency.

The design of the standardized work method includes activities such as:

- Identifying the tasks or activities that you want to standardize.

- Performing a detailed analysis of how these tasks or activities are currently performed, including the sequence of steps and activities, the resources used, and the results obtained.

- Identifying the best practices and methods used by different people or teams to perform these tasks or activities.

- Selecting the best practices and methods identified and developing a set of standardized procedures and techniques that will be used consistently and repeatedly to carry out the tasks or activities.

- Implementing and training people or teams in the use of standardized procedures and techniques to carry out the tasks or activities.

- Monitoring and evaluating the use of standardized procedures and techniques, and making adjustments to the design of the standardized work method if necessary.

The method must comply with all workplace safety requirements, with special emphasis on ensuring that the work is ergonomically correct, so that workers who must perform these tasks do not suffer injuries due to incorrect design of the workstation or the work standard.

Workplace safety is a fundamental aspect in any work activity, as it aims to protect the health and physical integrity of the people who work. Therefore, the design of the work method must take into account the safety of the people who will use it to carry out the task or activity, and must include measures and precautions that guarantee their safety.

Some measures and precautions that can be included in the design of the work method to ensure safety are:

- Identifying and evaluating the occupational risks associated with the task or activity to be performed, and establishing preventive measures to reduce or eliminate these risks.

- Designing a logical and optimized sequence of steps and activities that allows the task or activity to be performed safely.

- Designing a set of procedures and techniques that allow each of the steps and activities to be carried out safely.

- Providing the people who will use the work method with the necessary training and capacity to carry out the task or activity safely.

- Providing the people who will use the work method with the necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect their health and physical integrity.

- Conducting periodic inspections and reviews of the work method and the work environment to ensure that the established safety measures are met.

Likewise, when designing the method, we must also take into account other aspects that affect industrial safety and hygiene, such as proper lighting of the workstation, the possibility of screening machines to reduce noise reaching the worker, reduction of weights to be handled by the operator, etc.

## Conclusion

Mastering industrial time study techniques is essential for any professional seeking to optimize production processes. The systematic application of these methods not only improves operational efficiency but also significantly contributes to cost reduction and increased business competitiveness. Remember that precision in measurement and rigorous data analysis are the basis for establishing reliable time standards that drive continuous improvement in your organization.
