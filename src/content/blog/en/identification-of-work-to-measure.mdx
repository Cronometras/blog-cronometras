The work study must be clearly identified, so that in the future we are able to review the timing of a specific task from among all the production processes that we have measured through methods and time studies.

The better we detail the study, the easier it will be for us to later identify both the study and any possible changes that have occurred with respect to it.

As an example, we could take data such as:

1. The department that conducts the study, normally it will be the methods and times department in case the company has one.

2. Section: that section of the company to which the task we are measuring belongs or within which it is framed.

3. Operator: the name or badge number of the worker performing the task we are measuring.

4. Machines: the number or name that identifies the machines or work lines that are part of the time study.

5. Tools: those tools that the worker uses in all or part of the process to be measured as well as their general condition, such as a well-sharpened knife.

6. Name of the part: the name given to the manufactured part or piece.

7. Part ID: generally, in many companies, each of the parts or pieces that are manufactured has an identification or registration number.

8. Material: the material used in the measured process.

9. Environmental conditions: the conditions that exist at the time of measurement such as temperature, noise, lighting, etc.

10. Date: we will identify the date on which we conduct the study since there may be different studies of the same task on different dates.

11. Technician: the technician who conducts the study.

12. Company: company where the work study is conducted.

## Conclusion

Mastering industrial time study techniques is essential for any professional seeking to optimize production processes. The systematic application of these methods not only improves operational efficiency but also significantly contributes to cost reduction and increased business competitiveness. Remember that precision in measurement and rigorous data analysis are the basis for establishing reliable time standards that drive continuous improvement in your organization.
