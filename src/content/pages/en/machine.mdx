    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
      The Machine Times module of CRONOMETRAS is a specialized tool within our <a href="/en/features" class="text-accent hover:underline">industrial time study software</a> that allows industrial engineers, methods and times technicians, and production managers to perform precise studies of operations involving machines. Unlike traditional methods, our software allows you to:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 space-y-2">
      <li>Clearly differentiate between stopped machine times, running machine times, and machine cycles</li>
      <li>Identify concurrent times that do not affect the standard time calculation</li>
      <li>Perform measurements with hundredths of a second precision</li>
      <li>Manage and edit time records with comments and classifications</li>
      <li>Automatically adjust times according to configured frequencies and cycles</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
      The Machine Times screen integrates perfectly with the rest of the <a href="/en" class="text-accent hover:underline">methods study</a>, using the elements defined in the method, storing all records in the study's data structure, and contributing to the global analysis to identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies in machine-related processes.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
      According to recent studies on industrial productivity, companies that implement advanced work measurement systems like CRONOMETRAS manage to <strong>establish standard times up to 30% more accurate</strong> and <strong>increase their overall productivity by 15-20%</strong>.
