  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-800 dark:text-white">What is the Allowances Module in CRONOMETRAS?</h2>

  <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
    The <strong>Allowances Module</strong> is a specialized tool within <a href="/en/features" class="text-accent hover:underline">CRONOMETRAS</a> designed to calculate and apply necessary additional times to work elements. These allowances compensate for fatigue, personal needs, and environmental conditions, enabling the calculation of a fair and realistic <a href="/en/blog/standard-time-calculation" class="text-accent hover:underline">standard time</a> for workers.

/>

*   **ILO Tables (version 4):** System based on International Labour Organization standards, globally recognized for allowance assignment in time studies.
*   **TAL Tables:** Alternative system based on ILO tables but with more objectified factors, using precise measurements such as noise in decibels and lighting in lux.
*   **Dynamic Switching:** Ability to alternate between both systems according to the specific needs of each study, with compatibility alerts to avoid inconsistencies.

  }}
/>

*   **Complete Visualization:** Detailed list of all method elements with their description, type, and assigned allowance percentage.
*   **Quick Actions:** Functionalities to copy allowances between similar elements, saving time in configuration.
*   **Selective Reset:** Option to reset allowance values assigned to specific elements or the entire study.
*   **Visual Indicators:** Graphical representation of the allowance percentage applied to each element for quick assessment.

    imageClasses: "w-64 h-auto object-contain mx-auto section-image-hover",
    alt: "Point system for allowances in time and motion studies"
  }}
/>

*   **Structured Categories:** Factors are organized into three main categories:
    *   **Category A:** Physical effort (use of force, posture, vibrations, short cycle, uncomfortable clothing)
    *   **Category B:** Mental effort (concentration, monotony, visual strain, noise, mental tension, tedium)
    *   **Category C:** Working conditions (temperature, ventilation, gas emissions, dust, dirt, water presence)
*   **Interactive Tables:** Intuitive interfaces for selecting specific values for each factor according to its intensity.
*   **Automatic Calculation:** Instant conversion of assigned points to allowance percentages according to standardized algorithms.
*   **Specialized Interfaces:** Visual tools adapted for complex factors such as use of force, posture, and environmental conditions.

/>

*   **Direct Assignment:** Ability to manually establish an allowance percentage without using the point system.
*   **Selective Override:** The forced allowance overrides any previous point-based calculation, maintaining system flexibility.
*   **Specific Application:** Capability to apply forced allowances to individual elements without affecting the rest of the study.
*   **Automatic Documentation:** The system records that the allowance has been manually assigned for future reference and auditing.

*   **Comprehensive Analysis:** Detailed evaluation of machine running times, stopped times, and concurrent time.
*   **Adaptive Formulas:** Application of different algorithms according to operator inactivity time:
    *   â‰¤30 seconds: Formula for very brief inactivity
    *   31-90 seconds: Formula for brief inactivity
    *   91-600 seconds: Formula for medium inactivity
    *   >600 seconds: Formula for prolonged inactivity
*   **Weighted Allowances:** Calculation of allowances based on the relative weight of each element in the total work cycle.
*   **Detailed Explanation:** Step-by-step documentation of the calculation process performed to facilitate understanding and validation.
*   **Automatic Normalization:** Adjustment of times according to the recorded activity and frequency of each element to obtain accurate results.
