When creating our first work study, we will see our home screen which will contain the study we just created. Now 3 new buttons will appear:

1. Information button: from here we can access the screen where we registered all the information of our work study to complete any information we had not previously filled in.

2. Method button: when the work we are going to measure has a predefined method, we will enter the method screen to register the step-by-step work standard or work method that we will subsequently measure.

3. Continuous stopwatch button: when the work we are going to measure does not have a pre-established method, we will enter the continuous stopwatch screen where we can easily record the time that the worker is dedicating to each task.

To summarize, 2 different situations can occur:

- That a pre-established work method already exists or that we establish it before starting the measurement of work times. In which case we will create it from the method screen.

- That there is no pre-established method but even so we need to take times directly for the tasks that the operator is performing, to analyze them later, in which case we will work with the continuous stopwatch screen.

## Conclusion

Mastering industrial time study techniques is essential for any professional seeking to optimize production processes. The systematic application of these methods not only improves operational efficiency but also significantly contributes to cost reduction and increased business competitiveness. Remember that precision in measurement and rigorous data analysis are the basis for establishing reliable time standards that drive continuous improvement in your organization.
