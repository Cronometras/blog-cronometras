*   **Selection Panel:** Dedicated area that displays all currently selected elements, providing a clear view of the working set.
*   **Intuitive Selection/Deselection:** Buttons to add or remove elements from the current selection, with immediate visual feedback.
*   **Element Origin:** Each element shows the source study for better context and data traceability.
*   **Selection Management:** Option to clear the entire selection and start over, facilitating experimentation with different combinations.

*   **Intuitive Modal Form:** Clear interface for entering basic information for the new study, including name, company, date, and activity scales.
*   **Historical Data Preservation:** Automatic maintenance of allowances, time records, and configurations from the original elements.
*   **Integrated Validation:** Automatic verification that all required fields have been completed and that elements have been selected.
*   **Smooth Transition:** Automatic redirection to the newly created study, allowing immediate start of analysis.

*   **Dedicated Tab:** Specific section for calculating averages between similar elements, clearly separating this functionality.
*   **Intelligent Automatic Calculation:** Generation of a new element that integrates:
    *   Average time calculated from all selected elements
    *   Averaged allowances according to each element's configuration
    *   Detailed description documenting the source elements for traceability
*   **Results Visualization:** Panel displaying the averaged element with all its parameters before incorporation into the library.
*   **Perfect Integration:** Option to send the averaged element directly to the selection in the main library.

/>

*   **Simple Flow:** Direct selection of existing elements and immediate creation of a new study, ideal for quick analyses.
*   **Averaging Flow:** Creation of averaged elements from similar elements before incorporating them into the new study, perfect for standardization.
*   **Mixed Flow:** Combination of individual and averaged elements in the same study, offering maximum flexibility.
*   **Independent Selections:** Maintenance of separate selections in the library and average tabs, allowing parallel work on different aspects.
