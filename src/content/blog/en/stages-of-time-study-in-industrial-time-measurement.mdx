Work measurement is a systematic process aimed at evaluating and improving the efficiency and productivity of a company.

## 1. Selection of the work to be measured

One of the most important stages of this process is the selection of the work to be evaluated. In the case of time study, this selection may be motivated by various reasons, such as the appearance of new tasks, the identification of bottlenecks, the need to set standard times, or low performance or excessive downtime.

## 2. Selection of the worker to be measured

Once the task to be evaluated has been selected, it is important to choose the workers who will participate in the time study. This choice should be made fairly and equitably, taking into account the experience and skills of each worker.

It is also important to consider the relationship between the specialist in charge of the study and the workers, and to avoid any conflict of interest.

Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that the time study should be a collaborative and participatory process, in which both the specialist and the workers contribute with their knowledge and experiences.

To achieve an optimal result, it is important to involve the workers from the beginning of the process, explaining to them the objectives of the study and how it will be carried out.

## 3. Define the conditions under which the work to be measured will be performed

Once the task and the workers have been selected, it is necessary to define the conditions under which the time study will be conducted. This includes considering aspects such as the place where the study will be carried out, the necessary equipment and tools, and any other factor that may affect the execution time of the task.

## 4. Perform the time measurements

Once these conditions have been defined, it is necessary to conduct the time study itself. This involves recording the time it takes to complete the task, dividing it into its different parts and noting the time it takes for each of them.

It is also important to note any downtime or unnecessary time, in order to identify areas for improvement.

## 5. Analyze the results

Finally, it is necessary to analyze the results of the time study and look for ways to improve efficiency and productivity.

This may include the implementation of new methods or tools, the reorganization of work processes, or the training of workers in specific skills.

In summary, time study is a very useful technique for evaluating and improving the efficiency and productivity of a company.

It is important to carefully select the task and workers to evaluate, define the conditions under which the study will be conducted, record and analyze the results, and look for ways to improve.

It is also important to keep in mind that time study is not an isolated process, but part of a broader process of work measurement and continuous improvement. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate the results of the time study into an action plan that comprehensively addresses all relevant aspects for improving the efficiency and productivity of the company.

Furthermore, it is essential to involve all actors in the process, including management, workers, and supervisors, to ensure effective implementation of the proposed improvements. The participation and commitment of all members of the organization are key to achieving sustainable and lasting improvement.

## To which processes can it be applied?

It is also important to highlight that time study is a technique that can be used in different contexts and levels of the organization. For example, it can be used to evaluate the time it takes to perform a specific task in a workstation, or to evaluate the total time it takes to complete a process or production cycle. It can also be used to evaluate the time it takes to perform different support activities, such as order management or customer service.

In any case, it is important to adapt the time study technique to the characteristics and needs of each specific organization and context. It is essential to have a clear methodology and an adequate recording tool, and to follow a methodical and participatory process to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results. In this way, areas for improvement can be identified and effective solutions can be proposed to achieve greater efficiency and competitiveness.

## Other complementary tools

Additionally, it is important to highlight that time study is just one tool among many others that can be used to evaluate and improve the efficiency and productivity of a company. Some other tools and techniques that may be useful in this process include:

- **Methods study**: This technique is used to evaluate and improve work methods, with the aim of reducing the time and costs necessary to complete a task or process.

- **Value analysis**: This approach is used to identify and eliminate activities that do not add value to the final product or service, with the aim of reducing unnecessary time and costs.

- **Lean manufacturing**: This production philosophy focuses on eliminating waste and maximizing efficiency in all company processes.

- **Six Sigma**: This methodology is used to identify and eliminate errors and variability in processes, with the aim of improving quality and efficiency.

In any case, it is important to adapt these tools and techniques to the characteristics and needs of each specific organization and context, and to use an integrated and systematic approach to address the improvement of efficiency and productivity.

## Recommendations

Some additional recommendations to achieve sustainable and lasting improvement in this area are:

- Establish clear and measurable objectives and goals, and use appropriate performance indicators to evaluate the progress and impact of the implemented improvements.

- Involve all actors in the process, including management, workers, and supervisors, in the design and implementation of improvements.

- Use a data-based and evidence-based approach to identify areas for improvement and propose solutions.

- Foster a culture of continuous improvement and organizational learning, promoting innovation and experimentation to identify new ways of doing things more efficiently and productively.

- Ensure that the necessary resources and support are available to effectively implement the improvements.

In conclusion, time study is a valuable tool for evaluating and improving the efficiency and productivity of a company. However, to achieve sustainable and lasting improvement, it is necessary to adopt an integrated and participatory approach, establish clear objectives and goals, involve all actors in the process, and use a data-based and evidence-based approach. In this way, significant benefits can be achieved for the organization and its workers.
