## 1. Definition and Relevance of Industrial Time Study

**Industrial time study** is a fundamental technique in modern operations and production management. It involves measuring, recording, and statistically analyzing the time used by human workers, machines, or complex processes to carry out various tasks.

Despite decades of use in manufacturing contexts, industrial time study maintains its relevance thanks to the **numerous benefits** it brings to companies:

- **Increased productivity:** Allows identifying bottlenecks and improvement opportunities to optimize the use of time and resources.

- **Reduction of operational costs:** Facilitates precise estimation of production costs and identification of areas where expenses can be reduced.

- **Quality improvement:** Allows establishing time standards that contribute to consistency and quality in processes.

- **Production line balancing:** Helps to equitably distribute the workload among different processes and workstations.

- **Performance evaluation:** Allows establishing expected time standards and evaluating the performance of workers or machines.

- **Foundation for operational changes:** Provides valuable information to make changes in work methods and optimize processes.

## 2. Industrial Time Study Techniques

There are various industrial time study techniques, each with its specific advantages and applications. Among the most used are:

### **2.1 Methods and Motion Study (MMS)**

Methods and Motion Study (MMS) focuses on analyzing and improving existing work methods to optimize efficiency. A detailed observation of the worker's movements is made to identify areas for improvement, eliminate unnecessary movements, and reduce fatigue.

### **2.2 Time Study**

Time study aims to establish the standard time to perform a specific task. The time it takes a qualified worker to perform the task is timed, dividing the process into elements and recording the time of each one.

### **2.3 Predetermined Motion Time Systems (MTM, MODAPS)**

Predetermined Motion Time Systems (MTM, MODAPS) break down tasks into basic movements to which a predetermined time is assigned. It is primarily used for highly repetitive and standardized tasks.

### **2.4 Instantaneous Observation Methods (Work Sampling)**

Work sampling is a statistical technique that allows estimating the total time of a task by observing a representative sample of the work at regular intervals. It is useful for repetitive short-duration tasks or for groups of machines.

### **2.5 Standard Data Synthesis (Application of Historical Data)**

Standard data synthesis uses historical information of times from similar tasks to determine the standard time of a new task or to identify trends. It is a quick and economical technique, but less precise than others.

### **2.6 Analytical Evaluation**

Analytical evaluation is based on the analyst's experience and knowledge to determine the standard time. It is used for tasks that are not very repetitive or difficult to time.

### **2.7 Selection of the Appropriate Technique**

The choice of industrial time study technique depends on various factors, such as the objectives of the study, the nature of the task, the availability of resources, and the analyst's experience. In many cases, it is recommended to combine different techniques to obtain more complete and accurate data.

## 3. Application of Industrial Time Study

The application of industrial time study follows a systematic process consisting of the following steps:

### **3.1 Definition of Objectives and Scope of the Study**

It is essential to clearly establish the objectives of the study and define its scope, including the tasks or processes to be analyzed.

### **3.2 Selection of the Technique or Combination of Techniques**

Based on the objectives and characteristics of the study, the most appropriate industrial time study technique or combination of techniques is selected.

### **3.3 Data Collection**

Time and motion data are collected through direct observation, filming, automatic devices, or a combination of these methods.

### **3.4 Data Processing and Comparison with Benchmarks**

The collected data are processed and compared with benchmarks or reference standards to identify deviations and areas for improvement.

### **3.5 Analysis of Causes of Deviations and Identification of Improvements**

The causes of deviations from the standard time are analyzed, and opportunities for improvement in work methods, task distribution, process organization, etc., are identified.

### **3.6 Design and Implementation of Changes**

The necessary changes are designed and implemented to optimize the process.

## 4. Application Cases of Industrial Time Study

### **5.2 Integration of Filming:**

They facilitate detailed observation and analysis of the movements of workers or machines.

### **5.3 Centralized Database:**

They allow storing and comparing studies of different processes over time, facilitating the identification of trends and areas for improvement.

### **5.4 Automated Calculations:**

They automate the calculation of standard times, deviations, and other relevant indicators.

### **5.5 Report Generation:**

They allow generating detailed and customized reports with graphs and tables for a better understanding of the results.

### **5.6 Intuitive Interface:**

They offer friendly and easy-to-use interfaces for personnel without previous experience in industrial time study.

### **5.7 Example: CronometrasApp**

An example of specialized software for industrial time study is **[CronometrasApp](/)**. This application offers all the advantages mentioned above and allows conducting time studies quickly, accurately, and efficiently.

## 6. Conclusion

**Detailed time analysis through industrial time study** is a fundamental tool to optimize processes, reduce operational costs, improve quality, and increase productivity in any industrial sector.
