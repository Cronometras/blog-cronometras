  <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
    The <strong>Frequent Times Module</strong> is a specialized tool in <a href="/en/features" class="text-accent hover:underline">CRONOMETRAS</a> designed for the <a href="/en/blog/timing-of-frequency-elements" class="text-accent hover:underline">measurement and analysis of non-cyclic activities</a> in industrial environments. Unlike repetitive elements that occur in every cycle, frequent elements appear irregularly or randomly, such as adjustments, verifications, replenishments, or incidents. This module allows capturing, analyzing, and standardizing these activities to correctly include them in the <a href="/en/blog/importance-standard-time-productivity-profitability" class="text-accent hover:underline">standard time calculation</a>.

    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
      The CRONOMETRAS Frequent Times module is the definitive solution for analyzing and optimizing non-cyclic activities in <a href="/en/blog/methods-and-times-in-industrial-business-management" class="text-accent hover:underline">industrial and service environments</a>. Unlike traditional <strong>industrial time study</strong> methods, our software allows you to:

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 space-y-2">
      <li>Precisely record random or irregular activities that impact productivity with millimetric accuracy</li>
      <li>Visualize all frequent elements in a single organized view with relevant statistical data</li>
      <li>Edit and adjust parameters to refine your studies according to standardized international methodologies</li>
      <li>Establish realistic time standards based on real data and statistical analyses</li>
      <li>Improve resource allocation and production planning with precise data</li>
      <li>Seamlessly integrate frequent elements into the overall standard time calculation</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
      According to recent studies on <a href="/en/blog/importance-of-work-methods-and-time-study" class="text-accent hover:underline">industrial productivity</a>, companies that implement advanced time measurement systems like CRONOMETRAS achieve <strong>productivity increases of up to 15-20%</strong> in their operations and <strong>reduce study setup times by 35%</strong> compared to traditional methods.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
      The correct measurement and standardization of frequent elements can represent between <strong>10% and 25% of the total standard time</strong> in many industrial processes, which demonstrates the critical importance of having specialized tools for their analysis.
