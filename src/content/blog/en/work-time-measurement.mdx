For the establishment of work times, the application of different techniques is required to determine the time necessary for a qualified worker following a pre-established method to perform a specific task. With this, we will be able to detect and reduce waiting or unproductive times, as well as determine a fair standard time.

The most well-known techniques are:

## Estimation

Based on previous experiences, a certain time is granted for the execution of a specific job. There are jobs where the scientific study of times is not profitable, as they involve a small batch or isolated jobs.

In such cases, the time can be set "by eye" by an analyst:

- a person expert in the assigned task

- with aptitudes to set times based on direct observation

## Work Sampling

It is based on the random observation of times of what happens at the workstation, and if the sample (number of observations) is large enough, it can be inferred, according to the law of probabilities, that what happens with the sample times happens with the total work time.

It is used in workshops with a large number of identical machines.

## Standardized Data Tables

The elaboration of these tables is achieved after the systematization and expansion of data previously obtained by time study.

## Predetermined Times

This system is based on the decomposition of work into a series of elementary movements, whose times can be found in tables for this purpose. By applying very careful time measurement (films, by comparison of images) to the various micro-movements or therbligs that are repeated in the jobs, tables have been prepared that collect the times for each of them.

To use them, it is enough to decompose any method into therbligs and give each one the value already standardized in the table.

The total duration time will be the sum of the durations of the therbligs into which the work has been decomposed.

Different predetermined systems:

MTM1 (24 movements), MTM2 (9 movements), MTM3 (4 movements),

AND ADAPTATIONS SUCH AS MOST, WORK FACTOR, USD, SD (standard data), UAS (adapted to mass production), MEK (small series), etc...

Always apply the Activity Correction Factor (increase the resulting times by 11%)

## Time Study

This system uses a clock, stopwatch, Our Cronometras.com App, or other similar time measuring device for measurement. In this course, we will base ourselves on this system, which is the most widespread.

## Conclusion

Mastering industrial time study techniques is essential for any professional seeking to optimize production processes. The systematic application of these methods not only improves operational efficiency but also contributes significantly to cost reduction and increased business competitiveness. Remember that precision in measurement and rigorous analysis of data are the basis for establishing reliable time standards that drive continuous improvement in your organization.
