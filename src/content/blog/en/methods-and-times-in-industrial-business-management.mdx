Modern business management requires optimized and efficient processes to achieve success. In this context, the study of methods and times is fundamental. It consists of analyzing and optimizing a company's production and operation processes. The objective is to reduce the time needed to complete a task or project without compromising quality. This is achieved through the identification and elimination of unnecessary activities, the simplification of processes, and the implementation of best practices.

Business administration and management must incorporate these tools to remain competitive. Industrial time study and the study of specific operation times provide objective data on productivity. Thus, it is possible to detect bottlenecks, balance production lines, and focus improvement efforts.

Similarly, the study of methods examines the sequence of steps in a process. The objective is to simplify tasks, combine activities, and eliminate those that do not add value. Methods engineering generates more effective procedures, reducing operating costs.

Together, these concepts form a powerful business management strategy. Below, we delve into their fundamentals, implementation, and benefits:

## Modern Business Management

Today's companies face highly competitive and dynamic markets. Customers are increasingly demanding and seek high-quality products at low cost. To meet these demands, organizations must optimize resources and processes.

This is where business management takes center stage. It is the set of practices to efficiently manage and direct a company. Among its key areas are:

- Strategic planning: Companies must define their mission, vision, objectives, and long-term strategies. This allows them to anticipate changes and take advantage of opportunities.

- Resource organization: The aim is to optimize the organization of human, financial, technological, and material resources. Efficient resource allocation is key to maximizing productivity.

- Leadership and motivation: Leaders must inspire, empower, and develop their collaborators. This increases their commitment and performance.

- Operations control: It is essential to control and continuously improve operational processes. Tools such as Lean Manufacturing, Six Sigma, or Total Quality Management help with this. In addition, technology such as the [industrial time study app](/) CronometrasApp or big data, AI, and automation become key to streamline processes and gain insights.

- Continuous improvement: Innovation and continuous improvement are indispensable to maintain competitive advantages. Processes, products, and business models must be constantly reviewed. A collaborative and agile culture is sought. Flexible structures that foster creativity and experimentation.

Good business management will coordinate these activities. It will define objectives, allocate resources optimally, and monitor performance. Additionally, it will constantly seek solutions to increase productivity and customer satisfaction.

In practice, this requires agile and productive processes. Modern management methods emphasize waste elimination, standardization, and optimization. The study of methods and times fits perfectly into this philosophy.

## Principles of Methods Study

Methods study consists of systematically analyzing production processes. The objective is to improve procedures and reduce unnecessary costs. Its main steps are:

- Select the process to examine and record all its details.

- Evaluate each element of the process in terms of utility.

- Develop a new method, eliminating unproductive steps.

- Evaluate and define the new standard procedure.

- Implement the method and verify its effectiveness.

- Control its compliance and identify new improvements.

When applying these steps, principles such as the following should be considered:

- Elimination of tasks that do not add value. For example, unnecessary transportation and waiting.

- Combine operations to reduce handling.

- Change the sequence to facilitate workflow.

- Simplify inspections and control methods.

- Use devices that save effort.

- Take advantage of more efficient machines and tools.

- Design the workplace to minimize movements.

A comprehensive methods study reveals numerous opportunities for improvement. Even procedures established for years can be optimized. This increases productivity without the need to invest in technology.

## Time Study Techniques

While methods study focuses on how tasks are performed, time study analyzes how long they take. It allows measuring the duration of specific operations under determined conditions. Its main tools are:

- Time measurement: records with a stopwatch or the [CronometrasApp](https://cronometras.com/curso/cronometras-app/) app, of the time it takes to develop an activity.

- Predetermined times: previously tabulated data on the duration of basic movements.

- Work sampling: random observation of how time is spent during the workday.

- Time standards: established durations to perform a task according to its normal rhythm.

With this data, it is possible to identify delays and balance production lines. It also serves to estimate delivery times, schedule maintenance, and calculate costs. It is even used to design compensation and incentive systems.

When determining standard times, a "standard pace" of work must be defined. This corresponds to the speed at which a trained person develops a task without overexertion. It can be expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible cadence.

Well-conducted time studies provide accurate information on the duration of processes. Combined with methods, they form a powerful business management strategy.

## Implementation of Methods and Times Studies

The implementation of these techniques requires careful planning and change management. Ideally, a committee should be created with representatives from different areas. Its typical phases are:

- Select the processes to study according to their potential impact. Studies should first focus on bottlenecks and critical processes. This generates quick results that build support.

- Document the current method and times.

- Filming operations helps visualize improvements.

- Generate a new optimized method. It is essential to involve workers in the redesign of methods to leverage their experience. This improves adoption.

- Establish reasonable standard times. Standard times should be determined carefully, considering reasonable supplements for fatigue or contingencies, properly valuing the operator's activity, valuing the supplementation of waiting times for automatic machine work, when waiting times are short, as the machine must be attended by a worker...

- Test the new procedure and adjust it.

- Train employees in the change: Training employees is key before and during implementation. The benefits should be clearly explained to them and their feedback collected.

- Implement in a controlled pilot line. Gradual implementation by areas allows for adjustments and correction of problems before expanding to the entire company.

- Refine the implementation and standardize.

- Regularly audit its compliance. Periodic post-implementation measurements ensure that the benefits are maintained over time. Audits and regular updates of the methods are required as processes evolve, and senior management must monitor key indicators and actively communicate the achievements.

- Extend the learning to new processes.

Adequate preparation and worker participation facilitate adoption. Periodic measurements after implementation ensure the benefits.

It is important to note that the aim is not to accelerate work rhythms. A reasonable standard time allows for a fluid and repeatable operation. The objective is to eliminate inefficiencies, not to overload the staff.

## Benefits of Methods and Times Studies

Among the main benefits of implementing these techniques are:

- Cost reduction through increased productivity.

- Elimination of bottlenecks and downtime.

- Standardization of operations for less variability.

- Better plant layout and workplaces.

- Greater motivation by eliminating unproductive tasks.

- Foundation for designing fair compensation systems.

- Process optimization without substantial investments.

- Identification of automation opportunities.

- Fast and reliable deliveries according to standard times.

- Product redesign considering ease of manufacturing.

Clearly, the benefits impact the entire organization. Operations gain in speed and consistency. Production planning and control are facilitated. Costs decrease without sacrificing quality. All this translates into greater competitiveness.

### Practical Case Study

Let's look at an example of application in a wooden furniture factory:

- The manual sanding process took 12 minutes per piece. The aim was to reduce the standard time.
- The sequence of steps and movements was analyzed through filming.
- Inefficient movements when changing sandpaper and excess inspections were identified.
- The new method eliminated 4 steps and simplified the sandpaper changing process.
- The sequence and location of materials were standardized.
- The new standard time was reduced to 8 minutes per unit, 33% less.
- Production capacity increased without investing in more personnel or equipment.

This simple example illustrates the positive results. The application to more complex and broader processes generates great improvements in times.

## Consulting in Business Management

Given the extensive experience required, many companies turn to specialized consultancies in business management. These provide expertise to:

- Conduct diagnostics on current processes.

- Design indicator and management systems.

- Train personnel in new methodologies.

- Facilitate the implementation of improvements.

- Evaluate results and ensure benefits.

- Maintain a continuous improvement process.

Consultants bring an objective vision of optimization opportunities. They also provide support to overcome the natural resistance to changes in the way of working.

Typical consulting projects seek productivity increases of 25% or more. The methodologies used include:

- Methods and times studies.

- Lean manufacturing.

- Six Sigma.

- Theory of constraints.

- Total quality management.

Through the appropriate combination of these techniques, it is possible to reinvent business management. The benefits applied on a large scale are very significant.

## The Business Management of the Future

Looking to the future, business management will evolve incorporating new technologies. Data analytics and artificial intelligence will improve process analysis. Robotic automation will transform production.

However, the principles of methods and times studies will continue to apply. The elimination of waste through the systematic optimization of processes will be even more relevant. Successful companies will be those that can evolve quickly by adopting best practices.

In summary, modern business management has a powerful lever in industrial engineering techniques. Both the study of methods and times are indispensable to achieve agile and competitive organizations. Combined with new technologies, these methodologies will continue to create value and wealth.
