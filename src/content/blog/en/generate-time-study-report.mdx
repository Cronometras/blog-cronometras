Once we have completed all the data for our work study, we can automatically generate our report. To do this, on our home screen, we will slide the upper buttons to the left until the "Generate Report" button is visible.

## Access and Information on the Report Screen

Automate the methods and times report in a work time study

By clicking on the button, we will access the report screen.

On the first sheet of the report, we have the study information and directly the results of it.

We have information on normal and optimal production for each hour of work, we have the time of our normal and optimal cycle, we have the machine cycle time. We also have the minute value and the point value of our task.

Other relevant information that this screen shows us is the maximum activity that the operator can achieve, which in the case of restricted work will not reach the optimum of 133%.

We also see the saturation of the operator at normal performance and at optimal performance.

## Detail Sheet for Each Element

Each of the cycle elements has an information sheet about that element in which we have all the data recorded about it.

The information we have about the detail of a cycle element is:

- The type of element it is: Repetitive, frequency, or machine

- The frequency or number of units processed in each cycle

- The description of the task

- The average activity rated for that element on the centesimal scale 100-133

- The number of measurements taken for the element along with their activities

- The average observed time

- The total observed time

- The allowances applied, as well as the tables used and the detail of each factor

- Finally, the standard time calculated for that element

## Export Report to PDF

At the bottom of the screen, we will see a green "GENERATE REPORT" button. When clicking on it, if it's the first time, it will ask for permission to write to your phone or tablet's memory, as we are going to save a PDF file with your report on your device.

Once the necessary permissions are granted, a pop-up window will open where it will ask you to choose the program with which you want to view the PDF file.

When generating the document, it may take a few seconds to create, be patient, the application will freeze until the process is complete.

When choosing the program with which you want to view the report, it will open and you can print it, share it, file it, etc.

## Conclusion

Mastering industrial time study techniques is essential for any professional seeking to optimize production processes. The systematic application of these methods not only improves operational efficiency but also significantly contributes to cost reduction and increased business competitiveness. Remember that precision in measurement and rigorous data analysis are the basis for establishing reliable time standards that drive continuous improvement in your organization.
